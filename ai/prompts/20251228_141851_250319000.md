okay if a dollar sign token is prceeded by \\ then it will not be tokenized and processed. Also, if the CONTEXT section of our prompt.md is empty, it should not prossed tokens or copy to clipboard. Also if the user runs aic watch, then aic should not process the prompt.md on startup. IT should assume the user does not want init executiton. thank you
