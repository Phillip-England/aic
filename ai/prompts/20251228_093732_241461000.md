OK, whenever I create my AI directory, I would like it to have a prompt folder within it. That will hold the last 100 prompts that have been given to the system. These prompts will be in their raw form, not in their expanded form meaning that they will include their $tokens they will not be expanded to their full format. This is so that a user can go back and see the prompts that have been executed in the past, and instead of having to call the clear after function, let's remove clear from the system altogether instead, we should just clear automatically after every prompt and then stash the most recent prompt in the prompts folder of the AI directory if the prompt holder doesn't exist go ahead and create it.

After the prompt folder has 100 entries, go ahead and delete the oldest. This means we need some method of telling the age of a prompt file so if we need to include that go ahead and do it. In fact, it might just be best if we number them, idk ut we need a good way of doing this.
