No no right now I think my sequences want me to  type double quotes sequences should work like this:

I should be able to press:

SPACE
SINGLE QUOTE
SEMICOLON

If I type those keys in quick succession, then the system should be expecting a number to be typed next then if a number is typed next, that will choose which sequence is executed. I don't need to press double quotes or anything like that please thank you.
