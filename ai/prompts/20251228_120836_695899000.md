okay I need to break this code base up into multiple modules. 

Here is how I am thnking of this codebase at this point in time.

I have a aic_core which brings all ther other components together. core should simpley implement the logic of other modules.

Then I have an aic_dir which is responsible for directory generation, as well as reading and writing to the prompt file things like that.

then I have an aic_tokenizer which is responsible for tokenizing the prompt file. It produces a readable stream of tokens that can then be interpreted.

Then we have the aic_interpreter which is responsible for taking in a token steam and executing it.

then we have the aic_sequencer it is a module that watches the key board and responds to changes based on the keyboard like " ';1" for printing mouse cords.

finally, we have an aic_watcher which is responsible for setting up the sequencer and the prompt file watcher.

Is this a good design, if it is lets implement it.
