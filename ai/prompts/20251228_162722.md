okay we are going to create a ClipBoardWatcher which is responsible for watching content that appears on the clipboard.

right now, this watcher will simply print when it sees content appear on the clipboard. this needs to run in conjuntion with the other watcher. In fact we might need one watcher called prompt_watcher and then name the other clipboard_watcher

The clipboard_watcher should simply print "copied!" when something is copied for now.
