Okay I would like to implment a new LLM action. Here is how it works.

if we come across a line like this:

```bash
AIC: START;
AIC: REPLACE_START ./some_file.py 22;
line 22
line 23
line 24
line 25
AIC: REPLACE_END;
AIC: END:
```

when we hit REPLACE_START we will plan to be replacing lines in our ./some_file.py

This is relative to the ./ai dirs parent dir. The root of our project. Remember our root is ./ai/prompt.md one dir above ./ai

okay we will start replacing at line 22

This will overwrite lines starting at 22 and ending at however many lines we get until we hit REPLACE_END;

if we come acros a REPLACE_END; with no REPLACE_START to match, throw an error. Same thing wf we do not find an end, error out please.

report the error to the terminal.

Please make this happen.
