okay here is what we would like to do, for the clipboard watcher, we are reading it line by line and we are expeting commands.

AIC: START and AIC: END are our first commands, they together indicate we have received parsableinput on the clipbaord.

then, from there, we are in search of special lines begginging with

SOME_CMD: some input for the command

okay, this parser must be very strict.


Here is how it will work, the new command we will implment is SHELL:

it works like this:

if we find a line begginging with SHELL: ls we will simply execute the shell command.

Lets start there. We may need to make these commands their own module. Maybe ./pkg/llm_actions

and these commands can be known as agent actions.

we will need ./pkg/llm_actions/action_start.go and  ./pkg/llm_actions/action_end.go and ./pkg/llm_actions/action_shell.go

please implement this in a way that is growable for the future
