okay AIC needs a special way to accept keyboard commands, similar to the way vim works but this should work anytime the program is on, not just when the editor is in focus.

Okay, we need some sort of LEADER sequence thatll trigger if we need to execute a keyboard comand.

Here is how itll work, AIC will always be scanning for the sequence " ';" followed by some number or letter for example quickly typing " ';1" should print the current mouse cordanites to the terminal. Lets just start there. These are called "Sequences" and these sequences should be their own interface so each suqence has its own set of methods and file. Then we can start adding sequences to this system to do special things.
