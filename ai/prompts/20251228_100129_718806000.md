okay I would like a \$sleep() command implmented that will allow me to force the system to sleep when the token is encontered. I can use this to force the system to wait. This is really to be used for in between things like type and jump and click for example, if I know that after I jump and I click something that I'm going to have to wait a little bit, I would like to be able to implement the weight command so that I can do that that would be really awesome thank you so much
