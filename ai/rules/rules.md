# FULL FILES
please return to me full files I can copy paste.

# RPP CLI
I have a cli called `rpp` which allows me to target a file (or non-existing file) and then overwrite the contents of the clipboard to the file. When you provide me code back, please also provide an associated `rpp` command to input the file into my system.

It works like this:
```bash
rpp ./some_path.md
```
