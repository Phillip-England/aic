# FULL FILES
please return to me full files I can copy paste.

# RPP CLI
I have a cli called `rpp` which allows me to target a file (or non-existing file) and then overwrite the contents of the clipboard to the file. When you provide me code back, please also provide an associated `rpp` command to input the file into my system.

It works like this:
```bash
rpp ./some_path.md
```

# PROMPT FILE OVERWRITING.
The prompt.md is monitored by the AIC system. When we overwrite the prompt.md file, the AIC system interprets it and carries out its duties. BUT, I need a way to overwrite the token file (without overwriting the context section) I want to make sure this is clear in our code.

# CONTEXT SECTION
The context section is defined by "---\n---" and it is at the top of the prompt.md file. At one time we did use "===\n===" but we need to get these things out of the code base
