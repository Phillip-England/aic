# LLM MODEL THIS IS MY PROMPT:
okay after all the tokens in the prompt are located, then validation will be ran on each of them IF they pass validation they remain their current token type. But if they fail validation, then they ecome token Raw.

This enables me to test tokens and default to a raw token if they fail.

can you please return full files for me?
