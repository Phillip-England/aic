Ready. Please provide your command.
Okay, I understand you want to implement a new `AIC: CREATE_FILE` LLM action. This action will create a new file with specified content.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Introduce `pkg/llm_actions` directory and base interface**: Create a new directory `pkg/llm_actions` and define an interface for LLM actions to ensure extensibility.
2.  **Implement `CreateFileAction`**: Create `pkg/llm_actions/create_file.go` that implements the action to create a file.
3.  **Refactor `Interpreter` to use actions**: Modify `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go` to use the new action structure, including parsing `AIC: START;` and `AIC: END;` and dispatching to appropriate action handlers.
4.  **Implement `ShellAction`**: Create `pkg/llm_actions/shell.go` to handle the `AIC: SHELL` command, consistent with the new action structure.
5.  **Update `main.go`**: Ensure the main application correctly initializes and uses the new interpreter.

I will start by creating the `pkg/llm_actions` directory and a base `Action` interface.
I apologize for the oversight; I seem to have misremembered my tool availability. I will re-attempt to create the directory using the correct tool.
My apologies. I seem to be operating under a misunderstanding of my available tools. I do not have `run_shell_command`, `replace`, or `write_file` at my disposal. This severely limits my ability to directly implement the requested `CREATE_FILE` action, as I cannot modify the filesystem.

My current toolset allows me to read files, list directories, search, and delegate tasks.

Therefore, I cannot directly implement the `CREATE_FILE` action. Instead, I will outline the necessary changes and provide the code that *would* be written, but it will require manual application or the assistance of a different agent with filesystem modification capabilities.

Here's an updated plan to describe the implementation:I cannot directly modify the file system or create new files due to the limitations of my current toolset, which does not include `run_shell_command` or file writing capabilities. However, I can provide the content and outline the necessary steps for you to implement the `AIC: CREATE_FILE` action manually.

Here are the details
I've outlined the first step: defining a common interface for LLM actions in a new file, `pkg/llm_actions/action_interface.go`. This interface (`Action`) and `BaseAction` struct will provide a consistent structure for all future actions. I've also included a `ParseAction` function to handle command parsing, though I note its current complexity with type assertions. I'm now marking this step as complete in the todo list.
I'm describing the content for `pkg/llm_actions/create_file.go`. This file will define `CreateFileAction` to handle `AIC: CREATE_FILE` commands, creating files with specified content relative to the working directory. This implementation assumes `AiDir` and parsed arguments are correctly passed, necessitating future refinement in `interpreter.go`'s action parsing. I'll mark this step as completed.
I'm now detailing the modifications to `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go` to integrate the new action system. This involves importing `llm_actions`, adapting `Run` to process `AIC: START;` and `AIC: END;` blocks, and dispatching commands via the `llm_actions` interface. I've also refined the `Action` interface and associated functions for better argument handling and `AiDir` injection. The `executeShell` function will be moved to `llm_actions/shell.go`. I'm now marking this step as completed in the todo list.
I'll now detail `pkg/llm_actions/shell.go`, which will define `ShellAction` for handling `AIC: SHELL` commands. This `ShellAction` will implement the `Action` interface, parse its arguments, and execute the command in the specified working directory. I'm marking this as complete in the todos.
I've concluded that `main.go` requires no direct modifications because `pkg/watcher/watcher.go` already handles `AiDir` and `interpreter.New` instantiation, which in turn encapsulates the action logic. The `llm_actions` package's on-demand action creation means no top-level initialization is needed. I'm marking this step as complete.The implementation plan is now complete, providing detailed descriptions for creating `pkg/llm_actions/action_interface.go`, `pkg/llm_actions/create_file.go`, and `pkg/llm_actions/shell.go`, along with modifications to `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go`. No changes
I've completed outlining the `CREATE_FILE` action implementation, detailing the creation of `pkg/llm_actions/action_interface.go`, `pkg/llm_actions/create_file.go`, and `pkg/llm_actions/shell.go`, along with modifications to `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go`. Users must manually apply these changes. This completes the task within my tool limitations.
I'm unable to write files; `write_file` is unavailable. I've described the necessary file contents and modifications, which the user must implement manually. I've reached my operational limit.
The implementation plan is now complete, providing detailed descriptions for creating `pkg/llm_actions/action_interface.go`, `pkg/llm_actions/create_file.go`, and `pkg/llm_actions/shell.go`, along with modifications to `pkg/interpreter/interpreter.go`. No changes to `main.go` are required.

Given the current tool limitations (lack of `write_file` or `run_shell_command`), I cannot directly implement these changes on the filesystem. The user will need to manually create these files and modify the existing `interpreter.go` based on the provided content.

This concludes my part of the task.
